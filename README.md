# Black Jack *(Mobile Friendly)*
I have created the game of black jack also known as 21.
Using your cards, win by reaching a number closest to 21 without surpassing it. If you surpass 21 you will BUST and automatically lose the round. You play only against the dealer, trying to beat his cards.

# Getting Started
https://ronarnrio.github.io/BlackJack-Game/

Ace is 1 or 11. If the total of your first two cards is less than 11 the ace will become 11 if the total is greater than 11 the ace will become 1

2 - 10 are their original values

Jack, Queen and King values are 10

Press Play to begin playing and once the game has begun the player and dealer get 2 cards each if the first two cards add up to 21 which is an ace and a king or queen or jack then the dealer or player automatically wins that round. This is a "natural black jack"

Press Hit to recieve a card

Press Hold to end your turn then the dealer will take a card if the dealers hand value is less than 17 if the dealers hand value is 17-21 the dealer will hold and the players and dealers cards will be compared whoever is closest to 21 wins if the player or dealer go over 21 than they bust and will automatically lose the round.
# Next Steps
I would like to implement a betting feature
